# kubernetes-play-ground
Learning kubernetes by building a library management plateform   

*The goal of the project is to learn how to build and deploy several web services with kubernetes, therefore the quality of the sprinboot code
and that of the frontend is not of concern. I might improve it later, but the goal now is to get something up and running.*
